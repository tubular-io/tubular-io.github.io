IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, TUBULAR’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</span></p>
<h3><b>12. INDEMNIFICATION</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12.1 Tubular will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates a third party’s valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an “IP Claim”). Tubular shall, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Tubular for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify Tubular of the threat or notice of such IP Claim, (b) Tubular will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim, and (c) You fully cooperate with Tubular in connection therewith. If use of the Service by You, Users or End-Users has become, or in Tubular’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Tubular may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially and reasonably practicable as determined by Tubular, terminate Your subscription to the Service and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to Tubular for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term. Tubular will have no liability or obligation under this Section 12.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Tubular; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provisions of this Section 11.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Tubular to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Users or End-Users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12.2 You will indemnify and hold Tubular harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Tubular arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Users or End-Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided (a) We shall promptly notify You of the threat or notice of such claim; (b) You will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, and defend and/or settle any such claim (however, You shall not settle or compromise any claim that results in liability or admission of any liability by Us without Our prior written consent); and (c) We fully cooperate with You in connection therewith.</span></p>
<h3><b>13. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Tubular’s prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You in connection with any merger or change of control of Tubular or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13.2 These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Tubular with regard to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and any Form(s) shall apply in lieu of the terms or conditions in any purchase order or other order documentation You or any Entity which you represent provides (all such terms or conditions being null and void), and, except as expressly stated herein, there are no other agreements, representations, warranties, or commitments which may be relied upon by either party with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Tubular offers through the Service (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, We will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any User designated as an administrator on your Account activates the feature or functionality. Where there’ is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13.3 We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Tubular as Your consent to any such amendment. Tubular’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms.</span></p>
<h3><b>14. SEVERABILITY</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect.</span></p>
<h3><b>15. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties.</span></p>
<h3><b>16. SURVIVAL</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sections 1, 3, 4 and 9-18 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Users or End-Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Tubular’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms.</span></p>
<h3><b>17. NOTICE</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All notices to be provided by Tubular to You under these Terms may be delivered in writing (i) by nationally recognized overnight delivery service (“Courier”) or mail to the contact mailing address provided by You on any Form; or (ii) electronic mail to the electronic mail address provided for Your Account owner. You must give notice to us in writing by Courier or Mail to the following address: Tubular Limited, The Ormeau Baths, 18 Ormeau Ave., Belfast, BT2 8HS, United Kingdom. All notices shall be deemed to have been given immediately upon delivery by electronic mail, or if otherwise delivered upon receipt or, if earlier, two (2) business days after being deposited in the mail or with a Courier as permitted above.</span></p>
<h3><b>18. GOVERNING LAW</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</span></p>
