				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the continual arguing marketers and sales are like two peas in the corporate pod.  </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers are tasked with discovering and establishing the leads that will help get the product in the right hands; sales, puts that product in the hands of the consumer. As such, both jobs directly affect each other. If marketers can’t find where to place the product, sales cannot sell it. Likewise, if sales can’t sell anything, then marketers don’t know which products to pitch where.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when times are tough and sales begin to plunge, it’s usually the sales team that is pulled in and read the riot act. </span></p>
<p><strong>Boss – “Why are we not converting sales”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sales – “Marketing is giving us sucky leads.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marketing – “Sales couldn’t close a door, let alone a new client.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So herein lies one of the greatest organizational debates of all time: sales continually feeling that marketing provides them with sucky leads while marketing feels sales is just doing a sucky job at converting. Of course, this is nothing new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the dynamic between the two has always been complex, it has become even more so with the advent of SaaS. (Software-as-a-Service) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS as a business model in conjunction with sales automation has streamlined almost every digital aspect of the business from invoicing to traffic monitoring. Sales automation condenses the menial everyday tasks of a sales rep through artificial intelligence assistance. Now essential business practices like content marketing have never been easier.  With the added simplicity and efficiency of sales automation and the unrestrictive nature of selling digital products and services, anyone can become a Quasi-Marketer Sales God by using these digital tools. </span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting</span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest features of SaaS marketing tools is its ability to produce vast </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">snapshots</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your business’ performances across multiple channels. You can combine all your performance metrics and data into a single, shareable and easy-to-read dashboard. The software can be used to monitor the traffic metrics of your website and determine how many people have viewed the page and how long they’ve stayed on it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Sales, Revenue and Organizational reporting. <a href="http://www.tubular.io">Tubular</a> present all this information in the click of a button. Information that previously took hours at the beginning and end of the week can now be seen, visualised and actioned in a matter of minutes.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attracting Attention </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the implementation of SaaS services, content marketing has become streamlined and multifaceted. Apps like<a href="http:/www.buffer.com"> Buffer</a> allow you to actually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedule</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your social media content distribution immediately. You no longer have to work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publish posts one after another. Now marketers and salespeople alike can coordinate all social media outreach at one time with just a click of the mouse. Content creation and dispersion have never been easier.  </span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead Optimization </span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leads are the lifeblood of the sales department and should be treated as such. With the rise of email automated marketing leads no longer waste away in digital records. Historical information on l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eads is also more comprehensive than ever before. A.I and products like <a href="http://www.clearbit.com">Clearbit</a> and <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com">FullContact</a> help sales as they scour the internet for all fragments of data concerning users purchasing profiles and history. There are also algorithms for prioritizing leads to determine which still need conversion and which are ready to buy.  </span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved Communication and Collaboration </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of SaaS services are geared towards making communication across channels and departments within your business much easier. The digital feature that has benefited the most from this is video conferencing. Software such as <a href="http://www.gottomeeting.com">GoToMeeting</a> and <a href="https://www.zoom.us">Zoom</a> allows you to host conference calls with up to 100 people in HD. Some other benefits include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced scheduling features</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen sharing capability with the added ability to control transference (Another caller can use your keyboard and mouse)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-click recording </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing tools for increased interactivity </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS has also done wonders for real-time </span><a href="https://www.webcanopystudio.com/blog/saas-marketing-automation-tools-that-every-company-needs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work within businesses. Applications such as Canva allow all members to view, edit and comment on pictures, posters, social media posts, infographics, eBook designs, video thumbnails and everything in between. Salespeople can now collaborate on projects instantaneously rather than having to wait until the marketers have completed their research and developed their own leads.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales A.I is perfect for keeping track of all aspects of a business. It can create summary points from a sales rep’s calls with customers, take notes during meetings (in-person or online) and it can instantly distribute call scripts to entire departments.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved User Experience</span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to keeping customers is to keep them happy. Every aspect of their experience with the product should be productive and rewarding in some way. Sales automation A.I allow for efficient flow to the entire customer/user journey with the implementation of </span><a href="https://acquire.io/blog/sales-automation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chatbots offer intuitive and instantaneous support to customers through their ability to accumulate and analyze customer information in order to offer tailored guidance. Ironically enough, this digital assistance also adds a personal touch to the user’s interaction with the product, which does wonders in retaining them as longtime customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So who benefits the most from implementing sales automation and digital marketing into your business? The marketers or the salespeople? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Correctly implementing any type of new software can help you create comprehensive reports on sales and marketing activity. Now both salespeople and marketers can coordinate content creation and distribution and instantly respond to user queries. Anyone, whether they are in marketing or sales, can now access the business’ leads and reports and use that data to schedule email blasts, phone calls, and even their content marketing.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, sales automation is a double-edged sword for marketers and salespeople. It makes understanding marketing spend and tracking sales performance incredibly easy but can further blur the lines.</span></p>

				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustration can bring about one of two emotions. Either you become determined and find a new way to approach a problem, or utter dejection takes over. You shrug your shoulders and take the frustration as a fact of life. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are asked many times at Tubular, “What made you build a sales funnel CRM software in an industry that seems busy.” The answer is frustration. Frustration that CRM and sales software appears to be a control mechanism inserted into organizations without any particular division seeming to understand, or really care for, the organization objectives from adopting a CRM. From the thousands of conversations we’ve had with our clients since developing Tubular, we have learnt that many people shared our frustration. The most common question being…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are the existing CRM softwares so complex and difficult to use, and why does CRM implementation detract from the job many companies have to sell?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who follow the latest trends in sales will know that the traits which contribute to a successful sale tend to be resoundingly personal traits that can be attributed to the learned or natural skills of the sales person. Included are these traits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Confidence</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tone</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Trustworthiness</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Authenticity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these personal characteristics are not features within a CRM. Yet stumble upon a CRM landing page and you are given the false impression that implementing a CRM will convert sales just by merely opening up an account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sales CRM systems provide a platform to </span><b>engage, prospect, nurture,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>gather intelligence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which a salesperson can combine with positive personal traits to build great rapport and convert leads, prospects and clients into sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s take five points that sales CRM’s are incredibly useful for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Capturing leads</li>
<li>Engaging</li>
<li>Prospecting</li>
<li>Nurturing</li>
<li>Gathering intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all activities which you would prefer to be doing faster. It’s a no brainer, but if you were to ask a company if they would rather spend one minute accurately prospecting leads as opposed to 20 minutes prospecting a lead, you would choose the faster option, as long as accuracy is not lost in speed.<strong> Speed and accuracy can be a deadly combination.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that being said and as a huge inspiration for building <a href="http://www.tubular.io">Tubular.io</a>, we continually asked ourselves, </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is the CRM industry a throwback to 90’s-looking database industry, with little navigation providing an enjoyable User Interface (UI) or User Experience (UE)?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We set ourselves the following benchmarks.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we build a CRM where any analytical statistic relevant to a sales pipeline can be obtained in under 14 seconds, and in no more than six clicks?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we build a CRM with a minimalist interface that provides enough detail to engage, prospect, nurture and gather intelligence on a lead without looking like a Beethoven manuscript?</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes – but not overnight, and not without pouring hours and hours into updates and feature releases to ensure we never get away from our ethos. Updating your CRM should never be more than a few clicks away. After creating our benchmarks, we put ourselves to the test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test our benchmarks, we set up a list of tasks the people find a nuisance to perform in their CRM, the ones commonly forgone and that form organizational information silos. Can we create and complete these tasks in a matter of seconds? Can we make CRM software relevant and fun?</span></p>

<p><b>A unique interface!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In building Tubular, we realized that we had to keep a minimalist interface that provides enough detail to engage, prospect, nurture and gather intelligence on a lead without looking busy, or becoming too cumbersome for multiple divisions within a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you structure deal stages, deal tags, deal values, forecasts, forecasted weighted average, payment terms, emails, to-do’s calls and documents associated with a deal in one place – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with no information overload?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes, with the correct use of modals, drop-downs and infinite scrolling, you are able to remain concise yet provide detailed deal information to stay informed and on top of your sales pipeline.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tubular is a UK based Sales Pipeline CRM that puts User Interface and User Experience at the heart of every feature. It has numerous awards for its UI/UX design, including being ranked in Capterra’s top 10 most user friendly CRM software.</span></i></p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here are our favorite (<em>hidden</em>) features:</strong></h3>
<h3><b>Using your Organizations and Contacts as a company’s Global Address Book.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that Tubular can be used as your company’s global address book? That’s right. By importing and inputting the relevant contact details, you allow your team members to see their details as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this mean? Total transparency, and no more text messages, emails, or calls asking for people’s numbers. (Time Waster!)</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Contact details to Call and Email </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From within the Tubular </span><b>web-app</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Android application </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span><b> iStore application,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by clicking on the phone or e-mail sign, you can dial or email your contact from within your synced caller or email preference.</span></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="770" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/unearth-full-power-tubular/attachment/contact-details2x/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x.jpg" data-orig-size="1786,1584" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="contact details@2x" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x-300x266.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x-1024x908.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x.jpg" alt="contact details@2x" width="1786" height="1584" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x.jpg 1786w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x-300x266.jpg 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x-768x681.jpg 768w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/contact-details@2x-1024x908.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1786px) 100vw, 1786px"></p>
<h3><b>Sharing files with your team across Tubular</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From within the </span><b>new deal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> screen, the </span><b>paper clip</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below the timeline allows you to upload and share files,  providing your entire team with access to view that particular document. This is best utilized to share documents such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quotes, purchase orders, legal documents</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">contracts </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and written reports with your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This streamlines your sales tracking and improves efficiency in collaboration, so no more emailing or sharing multiple documents back and forth between  multiple people within your organization. These documents are time stamped and you can clearly see who within your team uploaded each particular file.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="776" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/unearth-full-power-tubular/attachment/attachements2x/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x.jpg" data-orig-size="2152,1584" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="attachements@2x" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x-300x221.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x-1024x754.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-776" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x.jpg" alt="attachements@2x" width="2152" height="1584" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x.jpg 2152w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x-300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x-768x565.jpg 768w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/attachements@2x-1024x754.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2152px) 100vw, 2152px"></p>
<h3><b>Archiving and Unarchiving Deals</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client has not demonstrated  interest for some time, you can archive  any individual pipeline. To  do so, click the</span><b> “view deals”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> button, then click </span><b>“archive.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can always move your archive deals back into your deals by clicking the </span><b>archived deals </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">filter button in your </span><b>deals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page. Click the </span><b>archived deals </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">button, </span><b>view deal,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  and click </span><b>un-archive. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The archived deal will now be shown in your current </span><b>deal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overview page. </span></p>
<h3><b>Assigning tasks to colleagues</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can unearth the full power of Tubular  when your team contributors  assist in task completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By clicking the </span><b>tasks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> button, you can get an overview of your team’s complete and incomplete tasks. This makes managing sales pipelines and teams easier within your organization.</span></p>
