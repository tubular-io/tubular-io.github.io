<p>A well-diversified sales pipeline can be broken down by</p>
<p><em>– Which region the deal is assigned to</em><br>
<em>– Which country the deal is assigned to</em><br>
<em>– The division that bought the sale to fruition (sales/marketing)</em><br>
<em>– How much of your pipeline is allocated to recurring revenue?</em><br>
<em>– Which advertising channel brought in the lead or deal</em></p>
<p>But how do you measure and arrange these details to ensure your strategic decisions are spot on when actioning your Sales Pipeline?</p>
<blockquote><p>Tagging!</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3183" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-e1518440443235.png" alt="" width="999" height="127" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-e1518440443235.png 999w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-e1518440443235-300x38.png 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-e1518440443235-768x98.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></p>
<p>We know the drill! It’s Monday morning, you live and breathe sales, and you want to get cracking on making those calls, chasing your leads, and closing those deals.</p>
<p><strong>But……</strong></p>
<p>As if to suck the life out of you, management needs a sales meeting. Hold that thought, management needs figures and performance results. The number crunchers need their say. What needs crunching, you ask? “Numbers,” they respond humorlessly.</p>
<ul>
<li>What did we close last week?</li>
<li>What’s in the active deal pipeline this week?</li>
<li>Did we close more last week than two weeks ago?</li>
<li>What’s our month-to-month growth?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms heavy. You feel yourself losing your clients already, hold the confetti.</p>
<p>Sales are measured by numbers, but to a salesperson reporting takes time. Hours better spent on building relationships and pushing through signatures. Reporting is retrospective analysis rather than forward-facing deal closure. Unfortunately, forward-facing relationship building doesn’t please the numbers guys, and so the sales team throws together a lifeless sales report that might keep management at bay for another 7 days.</p>
<p>Not only are sales meetings tedious, but they are also expensive! In his blog, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-long-should-meetings-last-randy-mccloskey-mba/">“How long should a meeting last?”  </a>Randy McCloskey predicts that your sales meetings cost your firm $340 per hour. Increase that to $1050 per hour if senior management is involved. A pricey few hours for your company to chew through first thing on a Monday morning.</p>
<p>At Tubular, we believe successful companies are built on using time efficiently. We have developed our sales reporting feature so it is responsive, intuitive, elegant and most of all simple, providing any company with the real-time stats they need to analyse their sales funnel.</p>
<p>Join the growing number of companies adopting Tubular, and learn why we can improve sales reporting, performance reporting, and organisational reporting.</p>
<p>The benefits of weekly, monthly and quarterly reports.</p>
<p><strong>1. Weekly reporting</strong></p>
<p>Aaaah! The joys of weekly reports. Those who cut their teeth on B2B sales can know that at times not a lot can progress in a week. Therefore, weekly reports can at times look relatively similar.</p>
<p>To combat this, we recommend you bring other Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) that turn your weekly sales reports from sluggish stationary charts into reactive, responsive reports.</p>
<p>Start by measuring not only closed deals, but also active deals, so you get a balanced view of how healthy your sales pipeline is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3184" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/simple-sales-performance-reports/attachment/performance-reports-weekly/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly.png" data-orig-size="1002,618" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Performance reports weekly" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly-300x185.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3184" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly.png" alt="" width="1002" height="618" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly.png 1002w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly-300x185.png 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-reports-weekly-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px"></p>
<p>“An active deal is a deal within the various stages of your sales pipeline; so that deals are not won, lost, trashed or archived.”</p>
<p>So by merely clicking the overlay of deals won this week vs deals won in previous week, I can start seeing the positive or negative weekly growth.</p>
<p><strong>Pros –  </strong>Errors, sticking points in the sales funnel. Any decrease in performance is quickly isolated before it becomes a long-term problem.</p>
<p><strong>Cons –</strong> Some sales lifecycles are too long to see any drastic change on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>2. Monthly reports</strong></p>
<p>An instant snapshot of a monthly report is where you can start making up-to-date actionable decisions that positively affect your sales pipeline.</p>
<p>Seeing your monthly closure rates can engage and incentivise your team to take affirmative steps to close their deals. Who knows? You might even find value in resuscitating some of the stagnant deals.</p>
<p>You can even dive into the revenue closed by sales rep by clicking the avatar on the right-hand side to get your personalised reports.</p>

<p><img data-attachment-id="3183" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/simple-sales-performance-reports/attachment/performance-reports-picture1/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-e1518440443235.png" data-orig-size="999,127" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Performance Reports Picture1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-e1518440443235-300x38.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-1024x478.png" class="alignnone wp-image-3183 aligncenter" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Performance-Reports-Picture1-1024x478.png" alt="" width="756" height="353"></p>
<p><strong>Pros –</strong> Percentage growth of deal flow and pipeline makes it easy to pick up the slightest of increase or decrease of performance.</p>
<p><strong>Cons –</strong> Honestly, every company should have a monthly sales report and analyse their active deal  flow through the month.</p>
<p><strong>Quarterly reports</strong></p>
<p>The time of the year where a brief overview isn’t enough. Sales reps need to stand up and report on segments, deal size, lead sources and closure ratios. Luckily, with Tubular this is not a difficult exercise. Quarterly reports are drawn up instantaneously for you and correlate with the data that has been uploaded to Tubular during the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that your sales quarter constitutes bonus time, so don’t be scared of pulling away from the pack to show off your position with the <a href="https://www.tubular.io/technology/can-gamification-increase-sales-teams-closing-rate/">Tubular Sales Leaderboard.</a></p>
<p><strong>Annual Sales report</strong></p>
<p>Everything is a panic at year end, the month can be short, or you may find yourself having to navigate your way around a short month interspersed with holidays with the same targets to hit, meaning hours upon an hours of distracting sales meetings.</p>
<p>Create calm amongst the ranks by having your annual sales reports ready at the click of a button. Watch how to build your Tubular reports by watching this<a href="https://vimeo.com/255048083"> video here.</a></p>

<li>Choose your Trigger App<br>
First you’ll pick the app that you want to start the Zap. Enter the app’s name in the search box.</li>
<li>Choose your Trigger<br>
Pick the specific Trigger for the app from the list of options provided.  With our example we are using <a href="https://www.typeform.com/forms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Typeform</a>, this might be <em>“new form entry”</em></li>
<li>Connect your App<br>
(<em>You will need your trigger app login details) A pop-up will appear, prompting you to authorize Zapier to connect to the app. Then click : Save + Continue.</em></li>
<li>Edit your options</li>
<li>Test your app.<br>
Click the “Fetch &amp; Continue” button to make sure the Trigger works. Wait for the success message before you proceed to the next step.<br>

]]&gt;</description>
				<encoded>Modern day marketers are finding that not many tools can improve sales or capture leads better than pop-ups.
<p>For any business, just having an opt-in pop-up can immediately increase their email opt-in, subscribers and leads.</p>
<p>If you are not optimising a pop-up, or worse not noticing a pop-up, it means users are leaving without any prompts or follow up. It’s hard to fix a lead generation system that misses out on a large portion of potential customers.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s a bit like inviting someone to your office and not talking to them!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>However, opt-ins are a double-edged sword – We, the consumer, are getting wise to them and know that parting with our email address invites the marketing drip campaigns. Whether these campaigns are overly aggressive or just not relevant to us can be a huge turn off in terms of engagement.</p>
<p>Follow these four tips to ensure your pop-ups pique the interest of your users.</p>
<h3><strong>1- Your call to action (CTA) needs to be strong.</strong></h3>
<p>Requesting someone join a mailing list is not good enough. The point should be that the content is strong enough to entice the user and make them feel that they are receiving relevant content.</p>
<p><strong>Originality</strong> is key. I like this pop-up from Switch playground</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2752" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/it-was-a-pop-up-i-swear/attachment/screenshot-2017-11-06-22-46-58/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.46.58.png" data-orig-size="712,376" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Screenshot 2017-11-06 22.46.58" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.46.58-300x158.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.46.58.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2752" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.46.58.png" alt="" width="712" height="376" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.46.58.png 712w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.46.58-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px"></p>
<p>We all leave an exercise class wishing that we had the music on our playlist.</p>
<p>Now we do by entering our info into the pop-up.</p>
<p>It’s original, it’s enticing, and it’s not a generic invite to a mail list. Think how you can apply this to your business.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>49% of all the pop-ups offer a lead magnet like an ebook, free content, tools, templates, promotions, or discounts. Think about how you can utilize this for your business.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2. Time your pop-ups correctly</strong></h3>
<p>There is nothing worse than getting halfway through an article and being interrupted by a pop-up. It is this sort of activity that leads to <strong>“banner-blindness,”</strong> so try to give your user 30-40 seconds on your website before hitting them with an offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>3. People love Free Sh…Stuff</strong></h3>
<p>36% of all brands use the word free on their banner. Be it free time or free access to premium content like an e-book.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2754" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/it-was-a-pop-up-i-swear/attachment/screenshot-2017-11-15-13-46-42/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-15-13.46.42.png" data-orig-size="701,614" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Screenshot 2017-11-15 13.46.42" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-15-13.46.42-300x263.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-15-13.46.42.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2754" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-15-13.46.42.png" alt="" width="701" height="614" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-15-13.46.42.png 701w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-15-13.46.42-300x263.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again there is a slight catch in that the “free” stuff needs to be good. If you are not <a href="https://tim.blog">Tim Ferris</a>, it can be hard to delivery quality daily content to a growing list, so it is best to give some thought to what your free offer is.</p>
<blockquote><p>Free consultation always works as it offers a prime opportunity to upsell.</p>
<p> </p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>4. The arrogance test</strong></h3>
<p>This tactic really does work. A pop-up with a provocative question. Just look how a provocative statement like, <em>“No Thanks, I prefer to pay full price for my clothing.” </em>effects email capture rate.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2753" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/it-was-a-pop-up-i-swear/attachment/screenshot-2017-11-06-22-57-34/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.57.34.png" data-orig-size="710,222" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Screenshot 2017-11-06 22.57.34" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.57.34-300x94.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.57.34.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2753" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.57.34.png" alt="" width="710" height="222" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.57.34.png 710w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-06-22.57.34-300x94.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px"></p>
<p>One thing I would recommend is that the message fits in with the brand reputation, so if the brand is bold and punchy then, by all means, go ahead. Entice your audience. <strong>It works!!</strong></p>

				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still managing your sales and business dev through Email and Excel spreadsheets? </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with manually handling this process, but it can turn something that’s relatively simple into a real pain. If sales are just one feather in your cap during your daily sales cycle, how can you separate this from your other work and focus on your core business? Or what happens if you need to scale up and more than one person is managing sales? Or what if your startup has just secured a series A investment round?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>You and your staff are now chasing sales and deals across multiple inboxes and email addresses.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re finding it difficult to hunt down the right emails from the rest of the junk.</em></p>
<p><em>Some correspondence is missing.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re handling multiple opportunities through one contact and finding it difficult to keep track due to crossover.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s been a lot of frustration over email the last few years, with Chat tools as one solution, so people are focusing less time on email and more time on being productive. To some extent, this has been successful.Email doesn’t need to be the go-to tool for all your communication  (our friends at Slack claim a <a href="https://slack.com/results">32% increase in productivity</a>!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, email is still one of the most robust channels of communication in business, particularly when you’re looking beyond in-house communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, many CRMs rely on email too much, requiring you to sync your whole email account with software before you can get started. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you continue to leverage the pros and minimise the cons when it comes to email and your sales process?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><b>Be selective</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don’t dump your whole inbox and address book into your sales software or CRM and end up in a bigger mess than when you started. Make sure you filter this down to only your active contact list before you do this.</span></p>
<p><em><b>Focus on the deals. </b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one contact has a number of deals on the table, you need to find a way to keep track of them all. </span></p>
<p><em><b>Avoid the dreaded, </b></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No Results Found’ </span></i><em><b>inbox search. </b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can take chunks of time out of your day.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could easily see the emails relevant to a particular deal and see them in context without needing to sync your whole email account? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://www.tubular.io">Tubular</a> we thought long and hard about how to work best with email. We wanted to develop something that was non-intrusive, flexible and easy to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That why we came up with our</span><b> BCC Feature.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In Tubular each deal you create is automatically assigned its own email address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose to copy this address into the BCC or CC line to field any email correspondence. By doing so, the email automatically gets added into your deals timeline. </span></p>

Correspondence is easily traceable and there is no mix-up between different team members as you can clearly see within the deal who sent the email to whom and when.  </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Select “<strong>Integrations</strong>“ from the left menu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1060" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tubular-integrations.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="414"></p>
<p> </p>

<p>Select from which Typeforms you want to import the data into Tubular.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the next step you will need to map the Typeform fields with the Tubular fields. This is as simple as selecting a field from dropdown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1060" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/integrations/attachment/integrations-hero-v2/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Integrations-hero-v2.jpg" data-orig-size="1108,717" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="integrations-hero-v2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Integrations-hero-v2-300x194.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Integrations-hero-v2-1024x663.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1060" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/map-typeforms.png" alt="" width="640" height="414"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>All that is left now is to confirm the import.</p>
<p>After confirmation you will receive message that import is underway. Your Typeform data is now being imported into <a href="https://www.tubular.io">Tubular</a>.</p>
