				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustration can bring about one of two emotions. Either you become determined and find a new way to approach a problem, or utter dejection takes over. You shrug your shoulders and take the frustration as a fact of life. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are asked many times at Tubular, “What made you build a sales funnel CRM software in an industry that seems busy.” The answer is frustration. Frustration that CRM and sales software appears to be a control mechanism inserted into organizations without any particular division seeming to understand, or really care for, the organization objectives from adopting a CRM. From the thousands of conversations we’ve had with our clients since developing Tubular, we have learnt that many people shared our frustration. The most common question being…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are the existing CRM softwares so complex and difficult to use, and why does CRM implementation detract from the job many companies have to sell?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who follow the latest trends in sales will know that the traits which contribute to a successful sale tend to be resoundingly personal traits that can be attributed to the learned or natural skills of the sales person. Included are these traits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Confidence</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tone</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Trustworthiness</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Authenticity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these personal characteristics are not features within a CRM. Yet stumble upon a CRM landing page and you are given the false impression that implementing a CRM will convert sales just by merely opening up an account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sales CRM systems provide a platform to </span><b>engage, prospect, nurture,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>gather intelligence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which a salesperson can combine with positive personal traits to build great rapport and convert leads, prospects and clients into sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s take five points that sales CRM’s are incredibly useful for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Capturing leads</li>
<li>Engaging</li>
<li>Prospecting</li>
<li>Nurturing</li>
<li>Gathering intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all activities which you would prefer to be doing faster. It’s a no brainer, but if you were to ask a company if they would rather spend one minute accurately prospecting leads as opposed to 20 minutes prospecting a lead, you would choose the faster option, as long as accuracy is not lost in speed.<strong> Speed and accuracy can be a deadly combination.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that being said and as a huge inspiration for building <a href="http://www.tubular.io">Tubular.io</a>, we continually asked ourselves, </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is the CRM industry a throwback to 90’s-looking database industry, with little navigation providing an enjoyable User Interface (UI) or User Experience (UE)?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We set ourselves the following benchmarks.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we build a CRM where any analytical statistic relevant to a sales pipeline can be obtained in under 14 seconds, and in no more than six clicks?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we build a CRM with a minimalist interface that provides enough detail to engage, prospect, nurture and gather intelligence on a lead without looking like a Beethoven manuscript?</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes – but not overnight, and not without pouring hours and hours into updates and feature releases to ensure we never get away from our ethos. Updating your CRM should never be more than a few clicks away. After creating our benchmarks, we put ourselves to the test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test our benchmarks, we set up a list of tasks the people find a nuisance to perform in their CRM, the ones commonly forgone and that form organizational information silos. Can we create and complete these tasks in a matter of seconds? Can we make CRM software relevant and fun?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following set of tests measured average number of clicks and average time it takes to complete each of the following tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>The Results</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tubular, leads are qualified and in your sales pipeline when they have a deal added to them. </span></p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/272349569" width="640" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><b>A unique interface!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In building Tubular, we realized that we had to keep a minimalist interface that provides enough detail to engage, prospect, nurture and gather intelligence on a lead without looking busy, or becoming too cumbersome for multiple divisions within a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you structure deal stages, deal tags, deal values, forecasts, forecasted weighted average, payment terms, emails, to-do’s calls and documents associated with a deal in one place – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with no information overload?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes, with the correct use of modals, drop-downs and infinite scrolling, you are able to remain concise yet provide detailed deal information to stay informed and on top of your sales pipeline.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tubular is a UK based Sales Pipeline CRM that puts User Interface and User Experience at the heart of every feature. It has numerous awards for its UI/UX design, including being ranked in Capterra’s top 10 most user friendly CRM software.</span></i></p>

				<encoded>Slack, the app that started life as a messaging app for building an online game, has enviable growth statistics. Currently, Silicon Valley is placing bets on Slack becoming the next decacorn ($10 billion), due to its viral growth.
<p>Stats like these back up the predictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 million active weekly users</li>
<li>2 million paid accounts</li>
<li>60,000 teams</li>
<li>An impressive annual recurring revenue of $200 million (USD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Great! Good news for Slack. But how can your business best utilize the app?</p>
<p>Firstly, stop seeing Slack as a messaging app. It’s a platform for increasing business productivity, which, when used correctly, will change the way you manage your business strategies and operations.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to create a killer Slack strategy.</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep it transparent</strong></p>
<p>The days of sales professionals guarding their leads as though their lives depended on it are dying fast—software now manages leads and promotes transparency. This prevents the classic case of Sales Agent A leaving company X, and taking their address book of contacts and leads with them (in all likelihood to your competitor).</p>
<p>Firms are waking up to the fact that sales funnels are collaborative. In the agency world, designers, copywriters, and account executives work together to submit prototypes, wireframes, and mockups to the client before contracts are even signed.</p>
<p>We recommend syncing the Tubular and Slack webhook, so your entire lead generation platform is online, and your team receives notifications whenever a lead comes in via a website, cold call, exhibition, or whatever lead generation strategy you have in place.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2665" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/business/leverage-slack-tubular-jumpstart-sales-pipeline/attachment/slack-reports/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports.png" data-orig-size="1200,752" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Slack-reports" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports-300x188.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports-1024x642.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2665" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports.png" alt="" width="1200" height="752" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports.png 1200w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports-300x188.png 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports-768x481.png 768w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Slack-reports-1024x642.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Strategize on a Monday</strong></p>
<p>Keep your team focussed and incentivized by pulling in daily, weekly, or monthly sales funnel statistics.</p>
<p>This provides a great instant snapshot to see where your sales funnel has any potential bottlenecks. Recognizing the bottlenecks makes it easier to create and implement a strategy to improve them.</p>

				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing worse in an organization than task duplication. Or, as business owners view it, paying twice for the same single outcome.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old-school sales philosophy stated that you need seven contact points with a client before they consider buying a product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be a sweeping statement, and lost in today’s world of analytics and Facebook impressions, but the message is clear: You need to create contact points between a client and business in order to be considered as the product or service of choice by a potential client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies have a winning formula, whilst some people rely on their memory needing a jolt before they recall, on the drive home, that they never got back to the client to submit a quotation or proposal. </span><b>Deal lost!</b></p>
<h1><b>Introducing Task Templates</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task templates have been introduced to streamline and allocate repetitive tasks to team members within your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how you can use task templates within your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, for example, you work for a company that submits repetitive documents for tender submissions. Often, the documentation and submission of a tender is more time-consuming than pricing the actual product on tender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This business has created templates to make sure the returnable documents of a tender are always compiled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">saving organizational time.</span></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1253" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/features/task-templates-closing-deals-just-got-quicker/attachment/task-templates/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Task-Templates.png" data-orig-size="640,400" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="task-templates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Task-Templates-300x188.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Task-Templates.png" class="size-full wp-image-1253 aligncenter" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Task-Templates.png" alt="task-templates" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Task-Templates.png 640w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Task-Templates-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second example, involves a contact point template, a set of 4 follow up actions are allocated to a sales team in order to push a potential or existing client through the sales pipeline. You can manage your team by setting the days and time allocated to complete a task. Add comments, and mark tasks as done once they have been complete</span></p>

				<encoded>The main office for Tubular is in London but we also have a satellite office in Bosnia where we work closely with a local university to support technology education and develop career paths for their students. I travel to our satellite office at least every four to six weeks which means that I have had ample time to perfect the art of business travel.

<p> </p>
<p>It is tempting to view travel time as a break from the office; as an opportunity to sit back in your airline seat and page through a magazine, read a novel or simply catch a snooze. The problem with this approach is that the business day does not stop simply because you are travelling – when you land there is sure to be a host of unanswered emails and messages demanding your attention.</p>
<p>Our team is highly-collaborative, we are constantly communicating with one another – whether we are in the same room, the same country or divided by an ocean – the flow of communication remains constant.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>The Right Tool at the Right Time. After some trial and error, we have landed on the right mix of tools to keep our team synched and to support a continuous flow of communication and productivity.</h4>
<h3>Slack</h3>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a robust team communication app; we use it almost exclusively for all internal communication. After implementing Slack, our email traffic was reduced by nearly 70%. Not only does this make our inboxes much less foreboding, it also gives us more time to focus on the emails we do receive, which are now primarily from customers and potential customers instead of the guy across the room.</p>
<h3>Buffer</h3>
<p>Staying on top of social media posts is a challenge even when I’m not travelling but mix in several hours of zero connectivity and maintaining our social media presence was nearly impossible – until I found Buffer. I load all of our social media content for the day while I am waiting to board my flight; then <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> posts all of it according to the schedule I established. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tubularapp/">Tubular’s social media activity</a> is seamless, even when I am offline.</p>
<h3>Intercom</h3>
<p>I’ve talked before about Intercom before in an earlier <a href="https://www.tubular.io/inside-tubular/secrets-exceptional-client-communication/">Blog</a>. We use <a href="https://www.intercom.io">Intercom</a> for both internal and external communication and it is fantastic. Anyone with the application installed can communicate with a member of our team in real-time. If a team member needs to be offline, there is a simple delegation option that ensures messages do not go unanswered. Our team has even turned reacting to support requests into a contest because of Intercom – each one vying to be the first to address an open ticket.</p>
<h3>Basecamp</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tubular.io/">Tubular</a> team is a huge fan of Basecamp and its founder Jason Fried; we have used it for at least five years to manage all of our project planning. I read <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/"><em>Getting Real – The Smarter, Faster, Easier Way to Build a Successful Web Application</em></a>, written by Basecamp’s founder, and it truly shaped the way I developed our companies. I followed it like the Bible and it became my inspiration for joining the SaaS world.</p>
<p>As a tool, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> is amazing. It ensures that everyone is aware of what everyone else is working on all the time. It completely eliminates the need for status meetings and maintains team momentum even when one of us is offline while travelling.</p>

<h2>Planning to Work – A Mindset of Productivity</h2>
<p>I never stop working simply because I am offline or away from the office – I continuing working on planes and while in cars. Treating a travel day as a business day has some unexpected benefits; rarely do I have several hours of uninterrupted time to focus on a project and I take full-advantage of those opportunities while I am traveling.</p>
<p>Inevitably, emergencies will arise when you are least equipped to address them so developing a plan for those that <em>are</em> connected to address those issues is essential. There is no worse feeling than reconnecting after a long flight only to find that you have 18 messages from a customer that is experiencing a tech support issue.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Never Play Catch-Up</h2>
<p>With the amount of travelling I do, it would be nearly impossible to do anything other than play catch-up if I did not maintain a consistent level of work on travel days. With all of the cloud-based applications available, there is no need to wait until you are “in the office” to work – the office is anywhere you have a connection.</p>
<p>Our own experiences traveling for business inspired the development of Tubular – we built our application to be just as supportive outside the office as it is inside the office. The native application ensures that users always have access to customer data enabling them to quickly make decisions and update the team on status changes.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on usability because we learned from our own needs – the more barriers to communication that exists; the less the team will communicate.</p>
<p>In a globally focused business environment, travel is inevitable. However, working with the constant stress of snowballing tasks does not have to be – use the right mix of tools and strategies to maximize travel days and never get stuck on the catch-up wheel.</p>

				<encoded>We’re excited to push out a little update that we have been working on at HQ. Not only have we finished this little update but we are hoping that this will be the start of many more integrations we have lined up for the second half of 2016.
<p><a href="http://www.cyfe.com/"><strong>Cyfe</strong></a> is an all in one Business Dashboard and with our new reports feature we offer you the ability see your sales pipeline in <a href="https://app.tubular.io/#/register">Tubular</a> in your Cyfe Dashboard.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can do it :</p>
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<h5>Create a Cyfe account and create your first dashboard. If you do not have an account you can create on <a href="http://www.cyfe.com/">here</a></h5>
<p><img data-attachment-id="595" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/news/tubular-cyfe-integration/attachment/screen-shot-2016-07-08-at-16-11-04/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-16.11.04.png" data-orig-size="519,184" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Screen Shot 2016-07-08 at 16.11.04" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-16.11.04-300x106.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-16.11.04.png" class="aligncenter wp-image-595 size-full" title="Tubular and cyfe integration" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-16.11.04.png" alt="Tubular and cyfe integration" width="519" height="184" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-16.11.04.png 519w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-16.11.04-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px"></p>
<h4>Step 2 :</h4>

<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<h5>Once you have created your desired Report, right click on the “<strong>Export CVS Report</strong>” Button and click “<strong>Copy Link </strong><strong>Address</strong>“</h5>
<p><img data-attachment-id="586" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/news/tubular-cyfe-integration/attachment/screen-shot-2016-07-08-at-15-09-42/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-15.09.42.png" data-orig-size="441,213" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Screen Shot 2016-07-08 at 15.09.42" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-15.09.42-300x145.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-15.09.42.png" class="aligncenter wp-image-586 size-full" title="Export CVS report of a deal" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-15.09.42.png" alt="Export CVS report of a deal" width="441" height="213" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-15.09.42.png 441w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-08-at-15.09.42-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"></p>
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<h5>Open up your Cyfe Dashboard in a new tab and click on “<strong>Add Widget</strong>“, once this screen is open click on the “<strong>Sales and Finance</strong>“, then “<a href="https://www.tubular.io/"><strong>Tubular.io</strong></a>“</h5>
<p> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="817" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/news/tubular-cyfe-integration/attachment/www-cyfe/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_.png" data-orig-size="1224,362" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="www.cyfe" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_-300x89.png" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_-1024x303.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-817" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_.png" alt="www.cyfe" width="1224" height="362" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_.png 1224w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_-300x89.png 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_-768x227.png 768w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/www.cyfe_-1024x303.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px"></p>
<p> </p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Step 5:</h4>
<h5>When the next popup appears click on “<strong>Configure Widget</strong>” here you will need to paste the link you copied from your report.

<p> </p>
<p>Watch this space as we add more and more of the features. We hope the release of our API in the coming months will open up all sort of possibilities and integration’s with Tubular in 2016 and beyond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks to Ben at <a href="http://www.cyfe.com/">Cyfe</a> for helping us make the integration official !</p>
