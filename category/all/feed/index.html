				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the continual arguing marketers and sales are like two peas in the corporate pod.  </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers are tasked with discovering and establishing the leads that will help get the product in the right hands; sales, puts that product in the hands of the consumer. As such, both jobs directly affect each other. If marketers can’t find where to place the product, sales cannot sell it. Likewise, if sales can’t sell anything, then marketers don’t know which products to pitch where.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when times are tough and sales begin to plunge, it’s usually the sales team that is pulled in and read the riot act. </span></p>
<p><strong>Boss – “Why are we not converting sales”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sales – “Marketing is giving us sucky leads.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marketing – “Sales couldn’t close a door, let alone a new client.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So herein lies one of the greatest organizational debates of all time: sales continually feeling that marketing provides them with sucky leads while marketing feels sales is just doing a sucky job at converting. Of course, this is nothing new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the dynamic between the two has always been complex, it has become even more so with the advent of SaaS. (Software-as-a-Service) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS as a business model in conjunction with sales automation has streamlined almost every digital aspect of the business from invoicing to traffic monitoring. Sales automation condenses the menial everyday tasks of a sales rep through artificial intelligence assistance. Now essential business practices like content marketing have never been easier.  With the added simplicity and efficiency of sales automation and the unrestrictive nature of selling digital products and services, anyone can become a Quasi-Marketer Sales God by using these digital tools. </span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting</span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest features of SaaS marketing tools is its ability to produce vast </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">snapshots</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your business’ performances across multiple channels. You can combine all your performance metrics and data into a single, shareable and easy-to-read dashboard. The software can be used to monitor the traffic metrics of your website and determine how many people have viewed the page and how long they’ve stayed on it.  </span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attracting Attention </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the implementation of SaaS services, content marketing has become streamlined and multifaceted. Apps like<a href="http:/www.buffer.com"> Buffer</a> allow you to actually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedule</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your social media content distribution immediately. You no longer have to work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publish posts one after another. Now marketers and salespeople alike can coordinate all social media outreach at one time with just a click of the mouse. Content creation and dispersion have never been easier.  </span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead Optimization </span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leads are the lifeblood of the sales department and should be treated as such. With the rise of email automated marketing leads no longer waste away in digital records. Historical information on l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eads is also more comprehensive than ever before. A.I and products like <a href="http://www.clearbit.com">Clearbit</a> and <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com">FullContact</a> help sales as they scour the internet for all fragments of data concerning users purchasing profiles and history. There are also algorithms for prioritizing leads to determine which still need conversion and which are ready to buy.  </span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved Communication and Collaboration </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of SaaS services are geared towards making communication across channels and departments within your business much easier. The digital feature that has benefited the most from this is video conferencing. Software such as <a href="http://www.gottomeeting.com">GoToMeeting</a> and <a href="https://www.zoom.us">Zoom</a> allows you to host conference calls with up to 100 people in HD. Some other benefits include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced scheduling features</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen sharing capability with the added ability to control transference (Another caller can use your keyboard and mouse)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-click recording </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing tools for increased interactivity </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS has also done wonders for real-time </span><a href="https://www.webcanopystudio.com/blog/saas-marketing-automation-tools-that-every-company-needs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work within businesses. Applications such as Canva allow all members to view, edit and comment on pictures, posters, social media posts, infographics, eBook designs, video thumbnails and everything in between. Salespeople can now collaborate on projects instantaneously rather than having to wait until the marketers have completed their research and developed their own leads.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales A.I is perfect for keeping track of all aspects of a business. It can create summary points from a sales rep’s calls with customers, take notes during meetings (in-person or online) and it can instantly distribute call scripts to entire departments.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved User Experience</span></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to keeping customers is to keep them happy. Every aspect of their experience with the product should be productive and rewarding in some way. Sales automation A.I allow for efficient flow to the entire customer/user journey with the implementation of </span><a href="https://acquire.io/blog/sales-automation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chatbots offer intuitive and instantaneous support to customers through their ability to accumulate and analyze customer information in order to offer tailored guidance. Ironically enough, this digital assistance also adds a personal touch to the user’s interaction with the product, which does wonders in retaining them as longtime customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So who benefits the most from implementing sales automation and digital marketing into your business? The marketers or the salespeople? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Correctly implementing any type of new software can help you create comprehensive reports on sales and marketing activity. Now both salespeople and marketers can coordinate content creation and distribution and instantly respond to user queries. Anyone, whether they are in marketing or sales, can now access the business’ leads and reports and use that data to schedule email blasts, phone calls, and even their content marketing.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, sales automation is a double-edged sword for marketers and salespeople. It makes understanding marketing spend and tracking sales performance incredibly easy but can further blur the lines.</span></p>

				<encoded><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustration can bring about one of two emotions. Either you become determined and find a new way to approach a problem, or utter dejection takes over. You shrug your shoulders and take the frustration as a fact of life. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are asked many times at Tubular, “What made you build a sales funnel CRM software in an industry that seems busy.” The answer is frustration. Frustration that CRM and sales software appears to be a control mechanism inserted into organizations without any particular division seeming to understand, or really care for, the organization objectives from adopting a CRM. From the thousands of conversations we’ve had with our clients since developing Tubular, we have learnt that many people shared our frustration. The most common question being…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are the existing CRM softwares so complex and difficult to use, and why does CRM implementation detract from the job many companies have to sell?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who follow the latest trends in sales will know that the traits which contribute to a successful sale tend to be resoundingly personal traits that can be attributed to the learned or natural skills of the sales person. Included are these traits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Confidence</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tone</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Trustworthiness</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Authenticity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these personal characteristics are not features within a CRM. Yet stumble upon a CRM landing page and you are given the false impression that implementing a CRM will convert sales just by merely opening up an account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sales CRM systems provide a platform to </span><b>engage, prospect, nurture,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>gather intelligence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which a salesperson can combine with positive personal traits to build great rapport and convert leads, prospects and clients into sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s take five points that sales CRM’s are incredibly useful for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Capturing leads</li>
<li>Engaging</li>
<li>Prospecting</li>
<li>Nurturing</li>
<li>Gathering intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all activities which you would prefer to be doing faster. It’s a no brainer, but if you were to ask a company if they would rather spend one minute accurately prospecting leads as opposed to 20 minutes prospecting a lead, you would choose the faster option, as long as accuracy is not lost in speed.<strong> Speed and accuracy can be a deadly combination.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that being said and as a huge inspiration for building <a href="http://www.tubular.io">Tubular.io</a>, we continually asked ourselves, </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is the CRM industry a throwback to 90’s-looking database industry, with little navigation providing an enjoyable User Interface (UI) or User Experience (UE)?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We set ourselves the following benchmarks.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we build a CRM where any analytical statistic relevant to a sales pipeline can be obtained in under 14 seconds, and in no more than six clicks?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we build a CRM with a minimalist interface that provides enough detail to engage, prospect, nurture and gather intelligence on a lead without looking like a Beethoven manuscript?</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes – but not overnight, and not without pouring hours and hours into updates and feature releases to ensure we never get away from our ethos. Updating your CRM should never be more than a few clicks away. After creating our benchmarks, we put ourselves to the test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test our benchmarks, we set up a list of tasks the people find a nuisance to perform in their CRM, the ones commonly forgone and that form organizational information silos. Can we create and complete these tasks in a matter of seconds? Can we make CRM software relevant and fun?</span></p>

<p><b>A unique interface!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In building Tubular, we realized that we had to keep a minimalist interface that provides enough detail to engage, prospect, nurture and gather intelligence on a lead without looking busy, or becoming too cumbersome for multiple divisions within a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you structure deal stages, deal tags, deal values, forecasts, forecasted weighted average, payment terms, emails, to-do’s calls and documents associated with a deal in one place – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with no information overload?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes, with the correct use of modals, drop-downs and infinite scrolling, you are able to remain concise yet provide detailed deal information to stay informed and on top of your sales pipeline.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tubular is a UK based Sales Pipeline CRM that puts User Interface and User Experience at the heart of every feature. It has numerous awards for its UI/UX design, including being ranked in Capterra’s top 10 most user friendly CRM software.</span></i></p>

				<encoded>It is no shock that marketing and sales teams often fail to collaborate. Research by the <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/11/why-sales-and-marketing-dont-get-along" target="_blank">Harvard Business School</a> highlights that marketing and sales teams can sometimes be in “all-out war” over resources, and this can have an adverse effect on business.
<p>Also, surveys have found that more than <a href="http://www.globalpartnersinc.com/Thought-Leadership/bid/82514/6-experts-explain-why-marketing-and-sales-don-t-get-along" target="_blank">half of businesses</a> don’t have a specific program to align sales and marketing teams. This oversight can result in 45% of qualified leads buying from a competitor within a year. The same survey found that only 16% of business thought their marketing and sales teams were collaborating.</p>
<h2>Three Sets Of Tasks</h2>
<p>Leaders need to split tasks into three groups: marketing, sales or a combination of both. Certain marketing only tasks include market research, competitive analysis, segmentation, brand position and other non-direct promotional activities. Sales tasks include personal selling, distribution management, merchandising and account management.</p>
<p>The tasks which both teams could be jointly responsible for include strategy formation, lead generation, pricing and forecasting.</p>
<p>So why can’t sales and marketing work together on these activities? Well, there are <a href="http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/why-sales-hates-marketing-9-reasons.html" target="_blank">five principle</a> reasons why they don’t.</p>
<ol>
<li>They compete for funding.</li>
<li>Marketing think selling is easy.</li>
<li>There is no corporate culture to support cooperation.</li>
<li>Traditional divides between departments are still present.</li>
<li>Their mindsets. Marketers tend to be proactive while salespeople tend to be reactive.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Aligning The Two Teams</h2>
<p>The answer to solving this issue is simple. Both teams need to understand their vital position for business growth. They also need to be trained to cooperate and use their strengths to better the organisation.</p>
<p>This can be done through initiatives such as holding inter-team meetings, coordinating promotional offers (including emailing promotional offers to the sales team) and allow teams to sit in on each other’s work. These activities could help both teams to have a renewed appreciation for each other.</p>
<h2>How Marketing Can Help Sales</h2>
<p>Of course, the real challenge is for marketing to prove its worth. They can only do this by ensuring their activities are supporting the goals of the sales teams and not counterproductive. Here are five ways that marketing can achieve this:</p>
<h2>1. Create Content Based On Sales Team Goals</h2>
<p>Each month or week, the sales team will have a set goal, for example, “sell X units this month/week.” The marketing team can create content, like blog posts, promotional emails and other materials to generate and qualify leads to pass on to the sales team.</p>
<h2>2. Share Information</h2>
<p>A survey in 2015, found that 63% of all businesses don’t have marketing and sales teams sharing information. However, marketing teams can help sales by passing on information such as consumer behaviour. This information can be used by the sales team to make better decisions on who are good leads to prospect and sell to.</p>
<h2>3. Create Sticky Information</h2>
<p>Case studies and testimonials are very influential to customers as they help to build trust. If a marketing team can produce these for the sales teams to use in their prospecting, then the time taken for initial contact to a sale could be reduced.</p>
<h2>4. Nurture Leads Better</h2>
<p>It can take between 5 and 12 interactions for 80% of customers to buy. That is a long time and a lot of money to spend on customer acquisition. This can be reduced if leads are better nurtured. Marketing can drip-feed information to customers and build trust before any salesperson calls the prospect.</p>
<h2>5. Join The Conversation</h2>
<p>Marketing people often know their products inside out. Therefore, they are the perfect people to jump on the phone and help convert tricky prospects. Marketing teams shouldn’t be afraid of making a sales call. Nor should they be ignored if they help. Instead, they should be rewarded when they help to bring a successful conclusion to a sale.</p>
<h2>Are Your Sales And Marketing Teams Working Together?</h2>
<p>Sales and marketing teams are often in conflict, fighting over resources and recognition. Instead, the departments need to combine their efforts to make their jobs easier. There are many ways that marketing can support the efforts of the sales team, and once they start providing assistance, the sales team will reciprocate.</p>
<p>Are your sales and marketing teams in conflict? How can your marketing team support your sales team?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People will only purchase your product when they know more about your business, and there is no way you’ll  be able to make a sale when you can’t be found.  Many businesses spend a great deal of  money just to create awareness of their products. That tells you how important it is to expose your business to potential customers.</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes lack of ideas can limit your ability to expose your B2B brand to the right customers, but here you will find the ideas that will increase your sales. Check out the  </span><b>B2B marketing ideas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below that will help every entrepreneur  succeed in their marketing campaign:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong> Go Local</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s best to take your business to a global level, but it won’t hurt you to first start earning locally.  It doesn’t matter if your business is large or small; local business listings can benefit you in a  way you might never have expected.  The good part about this  is that it favors Business-To-Business as well as Business-To-Consumer. You can try local business listings, such as <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing,</a> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> business pages and some other local business listings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The local marketing idea is very important to any business that wants to earn revenue from a local market. Google search results show relevant local business listings on the right side, and the local listings are part of the organic search results. It’s unfortunate that most businesses do not utilize this local marketing tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You too can attract customers through local business listings.  For example, if you are an accountant and you have established your presence  on local business listings but your competitors have not  done that yet, it stands to reason you will get more service requests than your competitors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Start a Blog</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has gone digital, and if you want to expose your business to a large number of online users, then you have to go digital too. Establish a blog that focuses  on your products and services. These days, if people need to solve a problem or buy something, they thoroughly search online for information, and you need to have a strong online presence  in order to have a chance to convince prospects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though competition is high online, try to optimize your blog  to get qualified customers to click on your links. It has been reported that<strong> 57% of companies who developed a blog for their businesses were able to significantly increase their customer base from their blogs.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how small your business is, with a blog you can establish your business as an industry leader. A blog makes it easy for you to connect and develop strong relationships with  existing and potential customers. You will be able to get comments and feedback that will enable you to improve your services.</span></p>
