<h3><strong>After years of being told to quit the games and get back to work, maybe all that time catching Pokemon and beating your friends at Mario Kart wasn’t completely in vain.</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out that if you’re looking for a way to boost your sales closing rate, gamification could be just what you need. One of the exciting trends to emerge in recent years, gamification is all about applying principles commonly found in games and applying them to non-gaming scenarios. Common applications include exercise (Runkeeper, Nike+), productivity (Habitica) and social networks (For example, LinkedIn use progress bars and Twitter uses followers as a way of keeping score). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But can gamification help you level up your sales process? Or is it just another fad that’s running out of lives?</span></p>
<h2><img data-attachment-id="3646" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/tubular-gamification-resize/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize.jpg" data-orig-size="960,577" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Tubular-Gamification-resize" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize-300x180.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize.jpg" class="wp-image-3646  aligncenter" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize.jpg" alt="" width="982" height="590" srcset="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize.jpg 960w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tubular-Gamification-resize-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px"></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamification in sales </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of trying to hit the top score is nothing new for sales teams. Ever since the first salesperson walked this earth they’ve had targets to hit, whether it’s the number of deals closed or the amount of revenue generated. The whole process makes it ideal for gamification  Much like hitting the high score in Candy Crush gets you bonus items and the top position on the leaderboard, salespeople beating their targets will typically receive rewards in the form of bonuses or recognition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern applications take this a step further. For example, Tubular.io features real-time sales leaderboards with instant feedback. We’re also working on an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELO scoring system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to calculate the relative skill levels of staff. These are important parts of gamification; when we’re rewarded in-game for performing the right actions, we’re also rewarded in real life with a dopamine hit. But to be effective and allow our brain to make the connection between the action and the reward, the feedback needs to be given as soon as possible. Platforms like Tubular allow for that instant feedback, reinforcing positive actions.</span> <img data-attachment-id="2871" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/technology/can-gamification-increase-sales-teams-closing-rate/attachment/leaderboard-small-compressor/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Leaderboard-Small-compressor.gif" data-orig-size="640,324" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Leaderboard-Small-compressor" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Leaderboard-Small-compressor-300x152.gif" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Leaderboard-Small-compressor.gif" class="size-full wp-image-2871 aligncenter" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Leaderboard-Small-compressor.gif" alt="" width="640" height="324"></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is all this really necessary?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what’s wrong with the good old fashioned deadline? Make X sales by Y date?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While deadlines may be a powerful motivator, they’re very much a stick, poking teams to work harder and faster in fear of punishment. Even the name sounds ominous. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadline</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I get goosebumps just hearing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, offering a carrot (rewarding positive actions) can be more effective for the entire process. How? </span><b>By gamifying task completion and processes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the right system and interface in place, completing tasks can be made fun. Updating records and reports can be changed from a dreary necessity into something staff actually </span><b>want </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So by gamifying the complete process, you can encourage good work ethics, with feedback for every process step, rather than just the final figure. For example, you can highlight staff who’ve made the most progress as the top ‘grower of the month.’ This allows us to nurture engagement within the sales team, and getting that employee engagement may be more critical for modern businesses than ever before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials now make up </span><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/11/millennials-surpass-gen-xers-as-the-largest-generation-in-u-s-labor-force/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the largest share of the American workforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but according to research by Gallup, </span><a href="http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/195209/few-millennials-engaged-work.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 29% of millennials are engaged at work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and only half plan to stick with their company for the next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the obvious costs associated with staff turnover, low engagement causes more problems. Gallup’s analysis found that business with high levels of employee engagement had:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">17% higher productivity,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41% less absenteeism,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10% better customer ratings,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21% more profits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line? An engaged sales team is a happy, productive sales team.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2870" data-permalink="https://www.tubular.io/technology/can-gamification-increase-sales-teams-closing-rate/attachment/task-small/" data-orig-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Task-small.gif" data-orig-size="640,180" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Task small" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Task-small-300x84.gif" data-large-file="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Task-small.gif" class="size-full wp-image-2870 aligncenter" src="https://www.tubular.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Task-small.gif" alt="" width="640" height="180"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Gallup’s study found clear expectations help, with 72% of millennials who strongly agree their manager helps them set performance goals are engaged. In both instances, gamification can help, providing a clear and familiar route to engagement as well as giving clear feedback on expected performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By associating ‘points’ and rewards with the metrics important to the company, gamification allows you to show your sales team exactly what they should be focusing on and provide that all-important instant feedback on whether they’re on the right track or not.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What lessons can we learn from Pokemon Go? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the summer of 2016, Pokemon Go was the sensation that seemed to be everywhere. At its peak, the game boasted </span><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/pokemon-go-first-anniversary-who-still-plays"><b>45 million</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily users. But while the hype may have faded, it taught us valuable lessons for gamification. The most important is, when done correctly, gamification allows us to encourage new behaviours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, while video games are traditionally associated with kids staring at a screen in a dark room for hours on end, Pokemon Go drastically changed that. People were going outside, walking around their neighbourhoods and interacting with other players face-to-face. Why? Because the game rewarded that activity. It made it fun!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in some instances, the game was a little too effective, and employees were fired for spending their time trying to ‘catch them all’ rather than on their work. What could make a person risk their livelihood for the sake of a game?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee engagement platform SelfDrvn believes the problem came from the game </span><a href="https://medium.com/@selfdrvn/powerful-gamification-lessons-from-pokemon-go-61950b49fe08"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing employee’s priorities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ‘In the case of the fired employees, they placed `Unimportant/Not Urgent tasks (playing Pokemon Go) in quadrant 1 [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s Important/Urgent tasks]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It became personally important and urgent to the dismissed employees. Why did that happen? Because of the fun that employees derived from the game. Pokemon Go uses mechanics considered fun by many. These include competing, exploring, teamwork, collecting, customizing, receiving rewards and leveling up.’</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lesson is clear: By using those same game mechanics to make the important tasks in your organization fun, your sales team will be eager to carry them out. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to be careful though. It would be easy to unintentionally create an overly competitive environment. That’s why it’s important to create team-based incentives that encourage overall teamwork, rather than focusing on individual goals.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready Player One?</span></h2>

				<encoded>Slack, the app that started life as a messaging app for building an online game, has enviable growth statistics. Currently, Silicon Valley is placing bets on Slack becoming the next decacorn ($10 billion), due to its viral growth.
<p>Stats like these back up the predictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 million active weekly users</li>
<li>2 million paid accounts</li>
<li>60,000 teams</li>
<li>An impressive annual recurring revenue of $200 million (USD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Great! Good news for Slack. But how can your business best utilize the app?</p>
<p>Firstly, stop seeing Slack as a messaging app. It’s a platform for increasing business productivity, which, when used correctly, will change the way you manage your business strategies and operations.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to create a killer Slack strategy.</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep it transparent</strong></p>
<p>The days of sales professionals guarding their leads as though their lives depended on it are dying fast—software now manages leads and promotes transparency. This prevents the classic case of Sales Agent A leaving company X, and taking their address book of contacts and leads with them (in all likelihood to your competitor).</p>
<p>Firms are waking up to the fact that sales funnels are collaborative. In the agency world, designers, copywriters, and account executives work together to submit prototypes, wireframes, and mockups to the client before contracts are even signed.</p>
<p>We recommend syncing the Tubular and Slack webhook, so your entire lead generation platform is online, and your team receives notifications whenever a lead comes in via a website, cold call, exhibition, or whatever lead generation strategy you have in place.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Strategize on a Monday</strong></p>
<p>Keep your team focussed and incentivized by pulling in daily, weekly, or monthly sales funnel statistics.</p>
<p>This provides a great instant snapshot to see where your sales funnel has any potential bottlenecks. Recognizing the bottlenecks makes it easier to create and implement a strategy to improve them.</p>
<p>Organize group meet-ups on Mondays, so you have the rest of the week to implement plans and efforts to nurture clients through the stages of your funnel.</p>
